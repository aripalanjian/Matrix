- Description: A header only linear algebra library

## About
Began as an exercise to develop mathematical equations while studying linear algebra at university to reinforce
the covered material. This project is in transistion from a compiled version to a header only library and thus at this time 
is not guaranteed to work. As I am able, I will update this library to more modern c++20 standards and to add multi-threading.
## Getting Started
- Download 
## Interface

## Overloaded Operators

## Future
- Update codebase to -std=c++20
- Add multi-threaded operation
